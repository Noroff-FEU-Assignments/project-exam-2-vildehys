## Brief for projects

An existing Social Media company has approached you to create a brand new front end for their application. While they have a list of required features, the design and user experience has not been specified. Working with the official API documentation, plan, design and build a modern front end social media application.

### Starting the project

A hosted demo of the project can be found at https://code-4.netlify.app/.

The project can also be started through cloning this repo, and running `npm start` command in terminal. This will cause the app to be viewed through localhost (port: 3000).

### Set up

The app also requires a valid and registered profile to start using it. This can be done through the registration form on the landing page. A stud.noroff.no/noroff.no e-mail is required, and a password of choice (\* minimum 8 characters).
After successfull registration, you're able to proceed to the login page. From here on you're able to view other users posts, a list of profiles registered, as well as an overview of posts. You can interact with other users through following (or unfollowing). You're able to view a single detailed profile as well as a detailed post, and react/comment to this post if wished. You have full access of your own user, which let's you update your avatar and banner using an image URL of your choice. From here you can also update content in- or delete posts that you've previously posted, and get a full overview of these.

## Reflection

The project is my finale delivery at Noroff and has been challenging and educational in many ways. I've been met with quite a few obstacles a long the way, that made it more challenging to face deadlines set earlier while planning out the project (Kanban). I'm happy with getting proper functionality to the page, but there's also several adjustments to both UI/UX in terms of design and functions that could've been reworked for the better. I'm happy with getting the site up and running, but still feel like I could've done better.

Thank you to fellow students for help and discussions around debugging and easier solutions, and contributions to the code - especially context part.
